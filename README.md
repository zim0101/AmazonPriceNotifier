# AmazonPriceNotifier

Searching for price changes of some products from amazon and notifiy the user via desktop notification if the prize changes. 
The products will be stored in database. The aplication will search for change after a periodic time.

The whole project is based on 3 module:
1. Console App
Where the user will interact with database to save or update products

2. Notifier App
Send desktop notification to alert user.

3. Scheduler App
This app will search for product price changes after a periodic time.

To start the application add it's execution program to your system cron job. Best if you can set the cron after every reboot.

More description will come soon!
